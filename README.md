# AssetManagement
Asset management is a website created using PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and bootstrap.
This website can be used to keep track of where your money is, means you can store details like
which asset has how much amount in it. assets like banks, crypto, stocks, mutual funds etc.
I have used MYSQL as a database and I have implemented a login logout system using sessions.
